# Square Breathing

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

Simple web app designed for square breathing technique.

Right now it's in the developement stage, so it's not going to work after
installling, but when I'll finish it, I'll publish working online version.

Technology stack: `React`, `Typescript`

## Design

I've came up with UI idea, and below I'm linking a few screenshots of it.
